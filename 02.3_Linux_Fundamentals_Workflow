***FILE DESCRIPTORS***
Data Stream for Input e.g. cat
STDIN – 0
Data Stream for Output e.g. find
STDOUT – 1
Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.
STDERR – 2

Redirecting input/output to files:
find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt

Add to existing file using >>
find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null

Redirect STDIN to a file
cat << EOF > stream.txt

Use GREP to filter results
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd

Count how many are in the file
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l


***FILTERS***
more [file] - A way to scroll through results
less [file] - Same as more but has "more" features
head [file] - Print the first 10 lines
tail [file] - Print the last 10 lines
cat [file] | sort - Sort alphabetically
cat [file] | grep "/bin/bash" - Filter results for /bin/bash
cat [file] | grep -v "/bin/bash" - Filter results for everything other than /bin/bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | cut -d":" -f1 - CUT is a delimiter, set with -d and position defined with -f
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " - FIND and REPLACE for file contents... Using tr first "" to find and second "" to replace
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | column -t - Do the above but split into columns
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | awk '{print $1, $NF}' - Do the above but only show first and last column
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | awk '{print $1, $NF}' | sed 's/bin/HTB/g' - FIND and REPLACE for whole files or STDIN using s to find and g to replace
? wc -l - Word count
