***NMAP***

***HOST DISCOVERY***
Syntax:
nmap [scan type] [options] [target]

Techniques:
-sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
-sU: UDP Scan
-sN/sF/sX: TCP Null (disable port scanning), FIN, and Xmas scans
--scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
-sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
-sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
-sO: IP protocol scan
-b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan

-oA [name] - Stores the scan with the name **It is recommended to store all scans
e.g. -oA [name] | grep for | cut -d" " -f5


-iL [list] - Scans against a list of IPs

-PE - Performs a ICMP Echo Request (ping) only scan
-Pn - Disable ping
-n - Disable DNS Resolution
--packet-trace - Shows all packets sent and recieved
--reason - Can give you a reason a host was marked alive or dead, etc.
--disable-arp-ping - So actualy ping results come back, not just arp pings

***HOST AND PORT SCANNING***

**TCP***
open - Connection established either via TCP, UDP or SCTP associations
closed - Packet back was RST
filtered - No response or error
unfiltered - Only seen during TCP-ACK scan, port is accessible but can't figure out if opened or closed
open|filtered - FW or Packet filter might be in place
closed|filtered - Only in IP ID Idle scan, indicates impossible to know if closed or filtered

-sS - Scans 1000 TCP defaults ports. Needs root
-sT - Default no root - TCP Connect scan - 3 way handshake
-p [x,x,x,x,x] - Define ports
-p [x-xx] - Define port range
--top-ports=[x] - Top x ports
-F - Fast and top 100 ports

--max-retries - default set to 1

Looking at timing might be able to show you if something is in the way:
SENT (0.0381s) - Nothing
SENT (1.0411s) - Possible Firewall

***UDP***
-sU - UDP scan
By default UDP will not respond unless configured to do so
If ICMP response 3 comes back, we know the port is closed

***SERVICES***
-sV - Service scan
