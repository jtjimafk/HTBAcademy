***HOST DISCOVERY***
Syntax:
nmap [scan type] [options] [target]

Techniques:
-sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
-sU: UDP Scan
-sN/sF/sX: TCP Null (disable port scanning), FIN, and Xmas scans
--scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
-sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
-sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
-sO: IP protocol scan
-b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan

-oA [name] - Stores the scan with the name **It is recommended to store all scans
e.g. -oA [name] | grep for | cut -d" " -f5


-iL [list] - Scans against a list of IPs

-PE - Performs a ICMP Echo Request (ping) only scan
-Pn - Disable ping
-n - Disable DNS Resolution
--packet-trace - Shows all packets sent and recieved
--reason - Can give you a reason a host was marked alive or dead, etc.
--disable-arp-ping - So actualy ping results come back, not just arp pings

***HOST AND PORT SCANNING***

**TCP***
open - Connection established either via TCP, UDP or SCTP associations
closed - Packet back was RST
filtered - No response or error
unfiltered - Only seen during TCP-ACK scan, port is accessible but can't figure out if opened or closed
open|filtered - FW or Packet filter might be in place
closed|filtered - Only in IP ID Idle scan, indicates impossible to know if closed or filtered

-sS - Scans 1000 TCP defaults ports. Needs root
-sT - Default no root - TCP Connect scan - 3 way handshake
-p [x,x,x,x,x] - Define ports
-p [x-xx] - Define port range
-p- - All ports
-sL - DNS Lookup
--top-ports=[x] - Top x ports
-F - Fast and top 100 ports

--max-retries - default set to 1

Looking at timing might be able to show you if something is in the way:
SENT (0.0381s) - Nothing
SENT (1.0411s) - Possible Firewall

***UDP***
-sU - UDP scan
By default UDP will not respond unless configured to do so
If ICMP response 3 comes back, we know the port is closed

***SERVICES***
-sV - Service scan

-sV	Scans the discovered services for their versions.
-sC	Perform a Script Scan with scripts that are categorized as "default".
--script <script>	Performs a Script Scan by using the specified scripts.
-O	Performs an OS Detection Scan to determine the OS of the target.
-A	Performs OS Detection, Service Detection, and traceroute scans.

--dns-server <ns>	DNS resolution is performed by using a specified name server.
Output Options
Nmap Option	Description
-oA filename	Stores the results in all available formats starting with the name of "filename".
-oN filename	Stores the results in normal format with the name "filename".
-oG filename	Stores the results in "grepable" format with the name of "filename".
-oX filename	Stores the results in XML format with the name of "filename".
Performance Options
Nmap Option	Description
--max-retries <num>	Sets the number of retries for scans of specific ports.
--stats-every=5s	Displays scan's status every 5 seconds.
-v/-vv	Displays verbose output during the scan.
--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms	Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout.
--max-rtt-timeout 100ms	Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout.
--min-rate 300	Sets the number of packets that will be sent simultaneously.
-T <0-5>	Specifies the specific timing template.



***SAVING RESULTS***
-oN - Normal .namp
-oG - Grepable .gnmap
-oX - XML
-oA - All formats

Tool: 
xsltproc - Convert XML to HTML for reports
e.g. xsltproc target.xml -o target.html


***SERVICE ENUMERATION***
-sV - Service version detection

If there is a long scan can use the space bar to see status or
--stats-every=#s or #m 

-v - Verbose
-vv - Very Verbose

Banner Grabbing
Nmap grabs banned to service detect but does not show this to us.
To see this information, which can be very helpful Connecting to the host on that port using "nc" and grabbing the info using tcpdump
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28
nc -nv 10.129.2.28 25

Usually looking for PSH flags (Flags [P.]) it can send extra info like the OS:
SMTP: 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)

Flags:
[S] = SYN
[.] - ACK
[S.] - SYN ACK
[P] = PSH
[P.] = PSH ACK
