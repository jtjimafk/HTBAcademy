***NMAP***

https://bencane.com/2013/02/25/10-nmap-commands-every-sysadmin-should-know/

***HOST DISCOVERY***
Syntax:
nmap [scan type] [options] [target]

Techniques:
-sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
-sU: UDP Scan
-sN/sF/sX: TCP Null (disable port scanning), FIN, and Xmas scans
--scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
-sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
-sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
-sO: IP protocol scan
-b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan

-oA [name] - Stores the scan with the name **It is recommended to store all scans
e.g. -oA [name] | grep for | cut -d" " -f5


-iL [list] - Scans against a list of IPs

-PE - Performs a ICMP Echo Request (ping) only scan
-Pn - Disable ping
-n - Disable DNS Resolution
--packet-trace - Shows all packets sent and recieved
--reason - Can give you a reason a host was marked alive or dead, etc.
--disable-arp-ping - So actualy ping results come back, not just arp pings

***HOST AND PORT SCANNING***

**TCP***
open - Connection established either via TCP, UDP or SCTP associations
closed - Packet back was RST
filtered - No response or error
unfiltered - Only seen during TCP-ACK scan, port is accessible but can't figure out if opened or closed
open|filtered - FW or Packet filter might be in place
closed|filtered - Only in IP ID Idle scan, indicates impossible to know if closed or filtered

-sS - Scans 1000 TCP defaults ports. Needs root
-sT - Default no root - TCP Connect scan - 3 way handshake
-p [x,x,x,x,x] - Define ports
-p [x-xx] - Define port range
-p- - All ports
-sL - DNS Lookup
--top-ports=[x] - Top x ports
-F - Fast and top 100 ports

--max-retries - default set to 1

Looking at timing might be able to show you if something is in the way:
SENT (0.0381s) - Nothing
SENT (1.0411s) - Possible Firewall

***UDP***
-sU - UDP scan
By default UDP will not respond unless configured to do so
If ICMP response 3 comes back, we know the port is closed

***SERVICES***
-sV - Service scan

--dns-server <ns>	  DNS resolution is performed by using a specified name server.

Output Options
Nmap Option	Description
-oA filename	      Stores the results in all available formats starting with the name of "filename".
-oN filename	      Stores the results in normal format with the name "filename".
-oG filename	      Stores the results in "grepable" format with the name of "filename".
-oX filename	      Stores the results in XML format with the name of "filename".

***SAVING RESULTS***
-oN - Normal .namp
-oG - Grepable .gnmap
-oX - XML
-oA - All formats

Tool: 
xsltproc - Convert XML to HTML for reports
e.g. xsltproc target.xml -o target.html


***SERVICE ENUMERATION***
-sV - Service version detection

If there is a long scan can use the space bar to see status or
--stats-every=#s or #m 

-v - Verbose
-vv - Very Verbose

Banner Grabbing
Nmap grabs banned to service detect but does not show this to us.
To see this information, which can be very helpful Connecting to the host on that port using "nc" and grabbing the info using tcpdump
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28
nc -nv 10.129.2.28 25

Usually looking for PSH flags (Flags [P.]) it can send extra info like the OS:
SMTP: 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)

Flags:
[S] = SYN
[.] - ACK
[S.] - SYN ACK
[P] = PSH
[P.] = PSH ACK


***NAMP Scripting Engine NSE***
14 Categories
auth	        Determination of authentication credentials.
broadcast	    Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
brute	        Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
default	      Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
discovery	    Evaluation of accessible services.
dos	          These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
exploit	      This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
external	    Scripts that use external services for further processing.
fuzzer	      This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
intrusive	    Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
malware	      Checks if some malware infects the target system.
safe	        Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
version	      Extension for service detection.
vuln	        Identification of specific vulnerabilities.


-sC - Default Scripts
--script [category] - All in category
--script [name],[name]... - Multiple individual scripts


Vulnerability Assessments
--script vuln

***Performance***
Optimum settings:
https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html
-T <1-5>
    -T 0 / -T paranoid
    -T 1 / -T sneaky
    -T 2 / -T polite
    -T 3 / -T normal
    -T 4 / -T aggressive
    -T 5 / -T insane
--min-parallelism <number>
--initial-rtt-timeout <time> - May cause some hosts to be overlooked
--max-rtt-timeout <time> - Amount of time it allows to recieve a responce. Default 100ms
--min-rate <number> - Using a number like 300 to increase speed of scans but don't miss hosts
--max-retries [number] - Default 10 - Again setting lower can cause hosts to be missed
--max-retries <number>
