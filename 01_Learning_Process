Creative Problem Solving:
1. Clarify - Identify the exact problem
2. Ideate - Brainstorm tonnes of ideas, nothing off limits, just put them on paper and keep going
3. Develop - Review ideas and choose the best one
4. Implement - Implement that solution, if it doesn't work go back to step 3

Questions to ask if in doubt:
- Have we already worked through all the material?
- Have we already seen what is being taught and how it is being taught?
- Do we already have to have the skills that are expected of us?

Guidelines for docs:
- It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
- Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
- Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.


Framing questions:
A rough question would be, for example, "How can I hack X?"
A precise question would be: "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"
