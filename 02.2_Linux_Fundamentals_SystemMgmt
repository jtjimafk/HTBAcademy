***USER MANAGEMENT***

sudo - Execute command as a different user
SU - Requests credentials from PAM and switches to that userID (by default superuser)

useradd - Add a user
userdel - Delete a user
usermod - Modify a user

addgroup - Add a group
delgroup - Delete a group

passwd - Change a password

Look at the MAN pages to the above.
One piece mentioned was for the "SU" function, use --command to execute a command



***PACKAGE MANAGEMNET***
Packages are archives that contain binaries of software, config files, dependencies and updates/upgrades.

Filetypes:
.deb
.rpm

Package management programs:
dpkg - Install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages.
apt - High-level command-line interface for the package management system.
aptitude -	Aptitude is an alternative to apt.
snap - Install, configure, refresh, and remove snap packages. Snaps enable the secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for the cloud, servers, desktops, and the internet of things.
gem	- Front-end to RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby.
pip	- Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation.
git	- Fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.


APT
Debian based
Makes installing easier as it auto grabs dependencies for packages

"apt-cache search impacket" - Command to search APT cache
"apt-cache show impacket-scripts" - Command to see additional infor about a package
"apt list --installed" - View installed packages
"sudo apt install impacket-scripts -y"


GIT
To create a folder and download a clone of a repo:
mkdir ~/nishang/ && git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git ~/nishang

DPKG
Downloading a package:
sudo wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/strace/strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

Depackaging:
sudo dpkg -i strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb 

Testing it works 
strace -h


*** SERVICE AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT ***
Daemons - Services that run in the background, usually appended with d e.g. sshd
Process ID - Can be found under /proc/

SystemCTL
Using SSH as an example:
systemctl start ssh = Start Service
systemctl status ssh = Check Status
systemctl enable ssh = Enable Service on Startup
ps -aux | grep ssh = Get PID
systemctl list-units --type=service = List all services
journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager = View CTL Logs

kill # - Kill a process
pkill
pgrep
killall

bg - send a process to the background
& - Auto send a process to bg e.g. ping 8.8.8.8 &
jobs - View jobs and ID's
fg # - send a process to the background

; or && or | - Execute multiple commands
; - All commands execute even if one failes
&& - If one failes the rest wont execute
| - Relies on no failures and also another process to have happened prior (grepping logs for example, something needs to have generated the logs)
